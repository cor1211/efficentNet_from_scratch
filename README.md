## 📌 Introduction
This project was built for **learning and research purposes**, focusing on the **EfficientNet architecture** in **Computer Vision**.  
Specifically, the model is trained **completely from scratch** to solve the task of **vehicle classification** (bus, family sedan, fire engine, etc.).  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The project uses the **Vehicle Dataset from Kaggle**.  
- The dataset contains various types of vehicles for image classification tasks.   

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Implements **all EfficientNet versions (B0 → B7)**.  
- The model is implemented **entirely from scratch**, **without any pretrained weights**.  
- Focuses on correctly reproducing the **EfficientNet design philosophy**:  
  - **Compound scaling**: scaling depth, width, and resolution simultaneously.  
  - **MBConv blocks**: using Depthwise Separable Convolution combined with Squeeze-and-Excitation.
